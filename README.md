# Mondrian
Mondrian Experiment
This folder contains a processing program to create pictures in the style of Mondrian. 
I have also added a folder with some pictures generated by the program. In order to be able to see the code as well as modify it, you need to download the processing editor.
You can change all the paramaters of the code, since it is well documented.
